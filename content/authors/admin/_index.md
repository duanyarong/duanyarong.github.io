  #  summary: |
  #    Object-oriented programming (OOP) lets you specify relationships between functions and the objects that they can act on, helping you manage complexity in your code. This is an intermediate level course, providing an introduction to OOP, using the S3 and R6 systems. S3 is a great day-to-day R programming tool that simplifies some of the functions that you write. R6 is especially useful for industry-specific analyses, working with web APIs, and building GUIs.

## About Me

I’m a PhD candidate at Victoria University of Wellington with a background in Comparative Politics and Diplomacy from Peking University and Beijing Foreign Studies University. My research focuses on ethnic conflicts, minority rights , and social movements, particularly in developing countries, with work on separatist movements in India and public opinion on governance.↳

I’ve tutored international PhD students, supported research on global political and economic issues, and helped grow a South Asian studies platform to over 120,000 followers. Outside academia, I love organizing community projects, exploring photography, and cycling. I’m always excited to collaborate on meaningful research and new ideas!
